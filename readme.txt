The program is structured in two text files. 
Project.java just acts like  specified in the lab manual with some unique screening methods to avoid bugs.
BTree.java has 5 classes inside it, a standard node class with left and right pointers, 
a conversion class that handles all the work before the input string is ready to be inserted into a tree,
two stack classes(one for tree nodes and characters of the string),
and a Tree class that has the all the traversing methods needed.
